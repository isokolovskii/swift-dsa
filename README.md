# Swift Data Structures and Algorithms

This project contains Swift playground with implementation of popular data structures and algorithms.

### Glossary

- DSA - Data Structures and Algorithms
- LIFO - Last in, First out
- FIFO - First in, First out

## Stack

Stack is LIFO data structure. Provided implementation is based on array.

## Queue

Queue is FIFO data structure. Provided implementation is based on array.

### Circular Queue

Circular queue is FIFO data structure with O(1) complexity of enqueueing and dequeueing(which is better than ordinary queue). Provided implementation is based on array
